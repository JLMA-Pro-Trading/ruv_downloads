**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Project Manager**: PM Agent  
**Swarm ID**: neural-dna-epic-001  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Foundation (In Progress)

## 📊 Overall Progress

- **Total Phases**: 4
- **Current Phase**: 1 (Foundation)
- **Days Elapsed**: 1
- **Estimated Completion**: Day 14

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

- [ ] Complete SDK implementation with DNA encoding/decoding
- [ ] Functional mutation algorithms with configurable policies
- [ ] CLI tools (dna-train, dna-spawn, dna-score) operational
- [ ] MCP hooks for swarm integration
- [ ] WASM build with web deployment support
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with evolution scenarios
- [ ] Full documentation in markdown format
- [ ] Integration tests with ruv-fann and ruv-swarm

## 📋 Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3) - IN PROGRESS

### Tasks
1. ✅ Set up project structure (Complete)
   - Basic directory structure created
   - EPIC issue defined
   - Initial plans documented

2. 🔄 Document prior work and references (In Progress)
   - Basic Neural DNA concept documented in plans/README.md
   - Need: DAA references, QuDAG documentation, neurodivergent trait catalog

3. ⏳ Define DNA encoding format (Pending)
   - Basic schema outlined in plans/README.md
   - Need: Formal specification in dna_overview.md

4. ⏳ Create trait specifications (Pending)
   - Need: Neurodivergent trait catalog
   - Need: Trait mutation policies

### Agent Assignments

| Agent | Type | Status | Current Task |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| Research Lead | researcher | 🟢 Active | Documenting prior work and DNA specifications |
| Neurodivergent Specialist | specialist | 🟢 Active | Creating trait catalog and behavior patterns |
| SDK Architect | architect | 🟡 Standby | Awaiting DNA specifications |
| Core Developer | coder | 🟡 Standby | Awaiting architecture design |
| CLI Developer | coder | 🟡 Standby | Awaiting core SDK |
| WASM Developer | coder | 🟡 Standby | Awaiting core implementation |
| Evolution Tester | tester | 🟡 Standby | Preparing test scenarios |
| Behavior Validator | tester | 🟡 Standby | Designing validation framework |
| Integration Expert | specialist | 🟡 Standby | Reviewing API requirements |

## 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

1. **Research Team** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Complete dna_overview.md with formal DNA encoding specifications
   - Document mutation_strategies.md with algorithm details
   - Create neurodivergent trait catalog

2. **Development Team** (Next Phase)
   - Review existing ruv-FANN integration points
   - Prepare development environment
   - Review DNA schema proposal

## 📈 Key Metrics

- **Documentation Progress**: 30%
- **Code Implementation**: 0%
- **Test Coverage**: 0%
- **Integration Status**: Not Started

## 🔄 Dependencies Tracking

### Blocked Items
- SDK implementation blocked on DNA specifications
- CLI tools blocked on core SDK
- Testing blocked on implementation

### Critical Path
1. DNA specifications → SDK implementation → CLI tools → Testing → Integration

## 📝 Notes

- Project structure successfully established
- Basic Neural DNA concept documented
- Swarm coordination active with 9 specialized agents
- Using hierarchical topology for efficient task distribution

## 🎯 Next Milestone

**Phase 1 Completion (Day 3)**
- All foundation documentation complete
- DNA encoding format finalized
- Trait specifications documented
- Prior work fully referenced
