# LinkedIn Introduction - Updated with npx ruvi CLI

Hitting 10,000 downloads in a single day feels like validation. For years, people questioned why I kept building command-line tools instead of flashy dashboards or apps. Now, CLIs are the hottest thing in AI. The irony isn't lost on me.

I've always built for how I actually work. For me, that's the command line. No clicks. No distractions. Just input, output, and flow. It's where I can think, build, and deploy faster than any interface designed to "simplify" things. CLIs force clarity. They make you intentional.

The fact that my tools are now downloaded hundreds of thousands of times a month is proof that simplicity wins. Occam's razor applies here too: the simplest solution often works best. Developers don't need another animated dashboard to tell them what's happening. They need tools that do the work, tell them what they need to know, and get out of the way.

That's why I built `npx ruvi`—a terminal-first way to access AI coaching, knowledge bases, and agentic systems. No installation, no setup. Just run it and get answers. Because the best tools disappear into your workflow.

If you're designing an agentic system, sure, build your candy-coated interface. But don't forget where real builders live. The terminal isn't outdated—it's the native habitat of developers. Build for how they actually work, not for how you wish they did.
